  <h3>AEGIS (AI Engine for Grounded Inspection System)</h3>
  <h4>A25-CS046 Capstone Project - Predictive Maintenance Copilot</h4>
</div>

### Theme
Accenture Use Case: AC-02 Predictive Maintenance Copilot

### Research Questions
1. How can Copilot-based Agentic AI transform reactive maintenance processes into data-driven predictive models across industries?
2. How effective are machine learning models (LSTM, XGBoost) in detecting anomalies and predicting machine failures from time-series sensor data with ≥70% accuracy?
3. How can agent architecture (LangChain/Autogen) translate natural language queries into insights and maintenance schedule recommendations?
4. To what extent can the implementation of interactive dashboards and Copilot chatbots accelerate decision-making and reduce O&M response times?
