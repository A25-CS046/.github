  <h3>AEGIS (AI Engine for Grounded Inspection System)</h3>
  <h4>A25-CS046 Capstone Project - Predictive Maintenance Copilot</h4>
</div>

### Theme
Accenture Use Case: AC-02 Predictive Maintenance Copilot

### Research Questions
1. How can Copilot-based Agentic AI transform reactive maintenance processes into data-driven predictive models across industries?
2. How effective are machine learning models (LSTM, XGBoost) in detecting anomalies and predicting machine failures from time-series sensor data with ≥70% accuracy?
3. How can agent architecture (LangChain/Autogen) translate natural language queries into insights and maintenance schedule recommendations?
4. To what extent can the implementation of interactive dashboards and Copilot chatbots accelerate decision-making and reduce O&M response times?

### Project Overview
<p align="justify">
  AEGIS (AI Engine for Grounded Inspection System) is an intelligent predictive-maintenance platform designed to transform traditional reactive maintenance into a data-driven, adaptive, and automated system.
  The project leverages machine learning, real-time sensor analytics, and Agentic AI to detect anomalies, predict equipment failures, and recommend optimal maintenance schedules across industrial sectors such as energy, mining, and manufacturing.
  By closing the gap between abundant sensor data and actionable insights, AEGIS enables industries to reduce downtime, enhance safety, and improve operational sustainability.
